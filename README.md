npm install
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=your_db_name
PORT=3000
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Application

## Data Structure Design
the data structure design i chose is to have single table for both the score and the users.
the rank of the player will be calculated on demand based on all the player score.

the reasons for this structure are
- on all the read queries the user and the score are always needed together
- the rank is calculated on demand because the rank can change on any user score update and if it will be saved the calculation can be heavy and cause problems wit the synchronization of the data
- the user and its score are standing alone so the maintaining of the data on  a big scale is easy

User {\
   &emsp; id: number;\
   &emsp; totalScore: number;\
   &emsp; name: string;\
   &emsp; image: string;\
}

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

### Table: `user`
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  image TEXT,
  "totalScore" BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
);
```

### View: `ranked_users`
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ranked_users AS
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  image,
  "totalScore",
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY "totalScore" DESC, id ASC) AS rank
FROM public.user;
```

### Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_total_score_desc ON public.user ("totalScore" DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_score_id_desc ON public.user ("totalScore" DESC, id ASC);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_users_id ON public.user (id);
```


### why this schema
- the view make it easy to query the users by rank or query the rank of a user
- view support millions of rows and can help organize the ranks dynamically without overlapping
- the indexes help improve performances of the view and queries by significant time

## üîå API Endpoints

| Method | URL                            | Description                            |
|--------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/users`                       | Add new user                           |
| POST   | `/users/:id/score`             | Update user‚Äôs score                    |
| GET    | `/users/leaderboard?limit=10`  | Get top N users (cached)               |
| GET    | `/users/:id/around`            | Get user rank + 5 above/below (cached) |



## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Architecture (Design-Only)

- **EC2** or **ECS Fargate** for NestJS service
- **RDS PostgreSQL** (with read replica)
- **ElastiCache Redis** for leaderboard caching
- **ALB** + **API Gateway** for routing
- **CloudWatch Logs** + **X-Ray** for observability
- **Auto Scaling Group** for API service
